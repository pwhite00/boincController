Ok but What is BOINC ??
  [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) is an open computing platform designed to use shared computing resources. It allows
  volunteers to use extra cou cycles to solve hard computuing problems by donting unused time on a local machine.
  
  Some of the projects that are avalable to volunteer on are:
    * [SETI@home](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/)
    * [IBM World Community Grid](https://worldcommunitygrid.org/)
    * [Einstein@Home](https://einsteinathome.org/)
    
    BOINC is distributed under the LGPL open-source license.
    
    This project is not directly affliated with the BOINC project.
    I am however a volunteer using the BOINC application.
    
    * This is a new project stil under initial development and as such is likley to change rapidlly for a while.
